Welcome, and thank you for choosing to participate in our study.

 

This 25 minute online survey is being carried out by a PhD candidate, Sam Taylor (supervised by Professor Greg Maio), and will ask you several questions about your own attitudes, thoughts and behaviours and your views on the attitudes, thoughts and behaviours of others in the area that you live. As part of this, you will need to be willing to give some indications of where you live (including the region of the UK and the first few digits of your postcode).

 

Ethics: At the end of the study, we will inform you in more detail about the aims and hypotheses of this study and give you the opportunity to provide feedback. Should you have any questions or wish to withdraw your data from the study at this stage, you may do so by emailing sjt80@bath.ac.uk within two weeks of completing the study and quoting your Prolific ID. You may also withdraw at any time by closing your browser window; any data collected up until that point will be deleted by the researchers. If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact the researchers (details below).

 

Eligibility requirements: You must be over 18 years of age and have lived in the United Kingdom for at least 5 years throughout your life (this does not have to be for the last five years or consecutively - just at least 5 years over the course of your life).

I remember it when it was a total shithole (pardon the phrase but it was). I never thought I would live here but I saw a great opportunity. I feel there is a good community spirit in the area. If anything happens people tend to care and help others - we hae a large residents facebook group. I love Newcastle and the people and of course the football of which I am a season ticket holder. I love the fact I can talk to anyone in the city and the will smile and chat. I don't find this happens in other places i the UK. I actually feel the rest of the UK is a fairly hostile place, so in that respect Newcastle is unique.

I do feel strongly about climate change and have two first class degrees and an MSC in environmental fields (science, economics and risk analysis) hence I feel qualified to judge. I am frustrated because there is not much we can do as individuals or communities on their own but if everyone did then it would make a small difference. The issue is china and india have ramped up coal production and burning and china just keeps building with concrete - their claims to be environmental aware are worthless.

I do beieve they should have taken heed of Nick Stern in the Stern Report but I am afraid it may bee too late. Still, they banned CFCs and replaced with HCFCs with the Montreal protocol but it needs global action, not just a small few.

I am going to send a much longer explanation of my answers to some of my questions on the separate 'contact the researcher' option as there is not enough space here. On the neighbourhood aspect you have asked me to decide whet the term means to me. My initial reaction was that as each respondent will have a different conception, there is no way to gauge or compare their answers or understand their context so any and all answers that I make will be both meaningless and add to confusion. Secondly, I don't think about a 'neighbourhood'. What can it mean, a geographical distance, a social construct, that makes little sense since these will generally cover people from many distances, long and short. It was your question, it was for YOU to define what it covered so I could answer accordingly. Personally I would describe it as broadly walking distance around your home. It is a vague and malleable term and concept. Lastly, you repeatedly use this word 'identify'   This is university speak. I am sorry if this sounds rude, it is not meant to be but the whole concept of  'identifying'' and naval gazing over identity is a narcissistic preoccupation of the young. Other generations simply did not and do not think in this way. My identity is my name. No other characteristic is part of my identity. I do not 'identify' with ANYTHING. If you mean like, enjoy,  approve of, agree with, have sympathy with, take part in, promote, etc please say so. Identify is a meaningless word in the real world. It started in the very first question. Which gender do you identify with. None. Gender is a linguistics term appropriated for a totally different use for political purpose. To even use the term is to push an assumption that everybody else agrees with or can FORCED to agree with your political outlook by forcing terms upon them. It is called sex. Nobody 'identifies' with either sex. If you are in doubt, you find your naval and then look due south. That will answer your question. There are only two types of discovery. The socket or the plug. Anything else is a mix or deliberate choice between ideology, fashion, anti scientific stupidity and mental illness. In a scientific study, only a question asking for sex is correct or appropriate. If you want to pander to the flat Earth gender ideologues you could ask for both sex and / or gender",5.996,1218.841,1219.627,49,4,6,,5,,1,,1,,,,,,5,BR2,1,2.57,48.531,49.334,19,,5a75a77817ef3500016ffd06

People have the same motivations as those in other areas of England (and probably much of the world too).  Obviously there are always exceptions, but generally speaking people only care about dying a slow death under the guise of security (work, money, mortgages/council properties etc.) because they know no better and think that these things actually mean anything.  Incidentally, the vast majority know little to nothing about the truly outdated nature of our society, and how it now stands diametrically opposed to all life-supporting systems on this planet, and also mother nature itself.  

I do not identify with my neighbourhood.  I do not commend it.  I sparcely even like it.  I merely exist because I am forced to.

Since then, we have dragged ourselves, kicking and screaming, up to this point, and now it is time to evolve.  

However, the vast majority of us do not even acknowledge that society is outdated; have a very skewed understanding of historical causality (generally attributing it to such mythological notions as ""human nature""), and so have a very skewed understanding of ourselves and humanity as a whole.  As a whole, we are completely oblivious to the reality that human biology and the environment are a working synergy.  

Indeed, I think people make the terminal mistake of trying to view, or understand society in isolated segments, whereas society has been shown by various researchers and scientists to be PROFOUNDLY interconnected and based on the principles of symbiosis.  Consequently, anyone who seeks to understand human behaviour, or society as a whole through the narrow lens of temporal biology (and most of all imaginary, abstract ""morality""), set themselves up for failure, because most if not all of our human propensities evolve in tandem with the environment -- or values of society as a whole -- and they do so transgenerationally to an almost infinite degree.  In lesser words (and with a less annoying vernacular), the causal mechanisms for what we have today have unfolded and evolved over thousands upon thousands of years.  

To put it another way, it is not humans that need to be studied and scrutinised, it is our outdated ""free"" market monetary paradigm.  If we understand how this value disorder coerces and dictates us in all regards, then we will eventually shine a light on ourselves.  

I recommend reading the book ""The New Human Rights Movement - Reinventing the Economy to end Oppression"" by Peter Joseph, and studying a ""Resource Based Economy.""

A lot of people do not like discussing such broad ideas because they are far too invested in their own spurious identities and ""achievements.""  If we ever want to change the world, we have to set aside our egos first.   

Thank you for this opportunity and your time.  Take care, Mem",613b89f37101459d36a4768f
